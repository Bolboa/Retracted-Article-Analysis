However, it is unclear whether inflammatory alterations are a cause or consequence of neurodegeneration leading to dementia. Clarifying this issue would provide valuable insight into the early diagnosis and therapeutic management of AD. To address this, we compared the mRNA expression profiles of cytokines in the brains of AD patients with ""non-demented individuals with AD pathology"" and non-demented healthy control (ND) individuals. ""Non-demented individuals with AD pathology"" are referred to as high pathology control (HPC) individuals that are considered an intermediate subset between AD and ND. HPC represents a transition between normal aging and early stage of AD, and therefore, is useful for determining whether neuroinflammation is a cause or consequence of AD pathology. We observed that immunological conditions that produce cytokines in the HPC brain were more representative of ND than AD. To validate these result, we investigated the expression of inflammatory mediators at the protein level in postmortem brain tissues. We examined the protein expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α and its receptors (TNFRs) in the brains of AD, HPC, and ND individuals. We found differences in soluble TNFα and TNFRs expression between AD and ND groups and between AD and HPC groups. Expression in the temporal cortex was lower in the AD brains than HPC and ND. Our findings indicate that alterations in immunological conditions involving TNFR-mediated signaling are not the primary events initiating AD pathology, such as amyloid plaques and tangle formation. These may be early events occurring along with synaptic and neuronal changes or later events caused by these changes.

Cell expansion needs to be carefully regulated to produce a correct shape and size. Polar cell growth is sustained by oscillatory feedback loops comprising three main components that together play an important role regulating this process. One of the main components are reactive oxygen species (ROS) that, together with calcium ions (Ca(2+)) and pH, sustain polar growth over time. Apoplastic ROS homeostasis controlled by NADPH oxidases as well as by secreted type III peroxidases has a great impact on cell wall properties during cell expansion. Polar growth needs to balance a focused secretion of new materials in an extending but still rigid cell wall in order to contain turgor pressure. In this review, we discuss the gaps in our understanding of how ROS impact on the oscillatory Ca(2+) and pH signatures that, coordinately, allow root hair cells and pollen tubes to expand in a controlled manner to several hundred times their original size toward specific signals.

"['Human cardiomyocytes express 3 distinct types of delayed rectifier potassium channels. Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels conduct the rapidly activating current IKr; KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels conduct the slowly activating current IKs; and Kv1.5 channels conduct an ultrarapid activating current IKur. Here the authors provide a general overview of the mechanistic and structural basis of ion selectivity, gating, and pharmacology of the 3 types of cardiac delayed rectifier potassium ion channels. Most blockers bind to S6 residues that line the central cavity of the channel, whereas activators interact with the channel at 4 symmetric binding sites outside the cavity. ', 'In response to diverse stimuli, two-pore-domain potassium channel TREK-2 regulates cellular excitability, and hence plays a key role in mediating neuropathic pain, mood disorders and ischemia through. Although more and more input modalities are found to achieve their modulations via acting on the channel, the potential role of subunit interaction in these modulations remains to be explored. In the current study, the deletion (lack of proximal C-terminus, ΔpCt) or point mutation (G312A) was introduced into TREK-2 subunits to limit K(+) conductance and used to report subunit stoichiometry. The constructs were then combined with wild type (WT) subunit to produce concatenated dimers with defined composition, and the gating kinetics of these channels to 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and extracellular pH (pHo) were characterized. Our results show that combination of WT and ΔpCt/G312A subunits reserves similar gating properties to that of WT dimmers, suggesting that the WT subunit exerts dominant and positive effects on the mutated one, and thus the two subunits controls channel gating via a concerted cooperative manner. Further introduction of ΔpCt into the latter subunit of heterodimeric channel G312A-WT or G312A-G312A attenuated their sensitivity to 2-APB and pHo alkalization, implicating that these signals were transduced by a cis-type mechanism. Together, our findings elucidate the mechanisms for how the two subunits control the pore gating of TREK-2, in which both intersubunit concerted cooperative and cis-type manners modulate the allosteric regulations induced by 2-APB and pHo alkalization.

However, its regulation on osteogenic differentiation with hiPSCs from human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the osteogenic differentiation of hiPSCs from patient-derived hGFs regulated by nHA/chitosan/gelatin (HCG) scaffolds with different nHA ratios, such as HCG-111 (1 wt/vol% nHA) and HCG-311 (3 wt/vol% nHA). First, hGFs were reprogrammed into hiPSCs, which have enhanced osteogenic differentiation capability. Second, HCG-111 and HCG-311 scaffolds were successfully synthesized. Finally, hiPSC/HCG complexes were cultured in vitro or subcutaneously transplanted into immunocompromised mice in vivo. The osteogenic differentiation effects of two types of HCG scaffolds on hiPSCs were assessed for up to 12 weeks.

"[StringElement('Studies of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections of humans are limited by the use of rodent models such as mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs. Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) are small mammals indigenous to southwest Asia. At behavioral, anatomical, genomic, and evolutionary levels, tree shrews are much closer to primates than rodents are, and tree shrews are susceptible to HSV infection. Thus, we have studied herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection in the tree shrew trigeminal ganglion (TG) following ocular inoculation. In situ hybridization, PCR, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses confirm that HSV-1 latently infects neurons of the TG. When explant cocultivation of trigeminal ganglia was performed, the virus was recovered after 5 days of cocultivation with high efficiency. Swabbing the corneas of latently infected tree shrews revealed that tree shrews shed virus spontaneously at low frequencies. However, tree shrews differ significantly from mice in the expression of key HSV-1 genes, including ICP0, ICP4, and latency-associated transcript (LAT). In acutely infected tree shrew TGs, no level of ICP4 was observed, suggesting the absence of infection or a very weak, acute infection compared to that of the mouse. Immunofluorescence staining with ICP4 monoclonal antibody, and immunohistochemistry detection by HSV-1 polyclonal antibodies, showed a lack of viral proteins in tree shrew TGs during both acute and latent phases of infection. Cultivation of supernatant from homogenized, acutely infected TGs with RS1 cells also exhibited an absence of infectious HSV-1 from tree shrew TGs. We conclude that the tree shrew has an undetectable, or a much weaker, acute infection in the TGs. Interestingly, compared to mice, tree shrew TGs express high levels of ICP0 transcript in addition to LAT during latency.

In an attempt to further develop the tree shrew as a useful model to study herpesvirus infection, we studied the establishment of latency and reactivation of HSV-1 in tree shrews following ocular inoculation. We found that the latent virus, which resides in the sensory neurons of the trigeminal ganglion, could be stress reactivated to produce infectious virus, following explant cocultivation and that spontaneous reactivation could be detected by cell culture of tears. Interestingly, the tree shrew model is quite different from the mouse model of HSV infection, in that the virus exhibited only a mild acute infection following inoculation with no detectable infectious virus from the sensory neurons. The mild infection may be more similar to human infection in that the sensory neurons continue to function after herpes reactivation and the affected skin tissue does not lose sensation.

UHRF2 effectively enhances zinc finger protein 131 (ZNF131) SUMOylation but does not enhance ZNF131 ubiquitination.

A key cause for the high mortality rate is the drug resistance that builds up for patients being currently treated with the chemotherapeutic agents. Although certain chemotherapeutic agents may initially effectively treat lung cancer patients, there is a high probability that there will be a reoccurrence of the cancer after the patient develops resistance to the drug. Erlotinib, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been approved for localized as well as metastatic non-small cell lung cancer where it seems to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations.

Using MRI, researchers can non-invasively examine the effects of eye disease on the whole visual pathway, including the lateral geniculate nucleus, striate and extrastriate cortex.

POAG patients also showed brain atrophy in both visual cortex and other distant grey matter (GM) regions (frontoparietal cortex, hippocampi and cerebellar cortex), decreased functional connectivity (FC) in visual, working memory and dorsal attention networks and increased FC in visual and executive networks. In POAG, abnormalities in structure and FC within and outside visual system correlated with visual field parameters in the poorer performing eyes, thus emphasizing their clinical relevance.

GDM-associated maternal hyperglycaemia result in fetal hyperglycaemia, a condition that leads to fetal hyperinsulinemia and altered L-arginine transport and synthesis of nitric oxide, i.e., endothelial dysfunction. These alterations in the fetoplacental endothelial function are present in women with GDM that were under diet or insulin therapy. Since these women and their newborn show normal glycaemia at term, other factors or conditions could be altered and/or not resolved by restoring normal level of circulating D-glucose. GDM associates with metabolic disturbances, such as abnormal handling of the locally released vasodilator adenosine, and biosynthesis and metabolism of cholesterol lipoproteins, or metabolic diseases resulting in endoplasmic reticulum stress and altered angiogenesis. Insulin acts as a potent modulator of all these phenomena under normal conditions as reported in primary cultures of cells obtained from the human placenta; however, GDM and the role of insulin regarding these alterations in this disease are poorly understood. This review focuses on the potential link between insulin and endoplasmic reticulum stress, hypercholesterolemia, and angiogenesis in GDM in the human fetoplacental vasculature. Based in reports in primary culture placental endothelium we propose that insulin is a factor restoring endothelial function in GDM by reversing ERS, hypercholesterolaemia and angiogenesis to a physiological state involving insulin activation of insulin receptor isoforms and adenosine receptors and metabolism in the human placenta from GDM pregnancies.

"['2+ and the activity of neutral sphingomyelinase but not clathrin-coated pit maturation. ATP-independent endocytosis represents a non-canonical mechanism that can efficiently retrieve membrane at physiological conditions without competing for the limited ATP at elevated neuronal activity.', StringElement('Neurotransmission relies on membrane endocytosis to maintain vesicle supply and membrane stability. Endocytosis has been generally recognized as a major ATP-dependent function, which efficiently retrieves more membrane at elevated neuronal activity when ATP consumption within nerve terminals increases drastically. This paradox raises the interesting question of whether increased activity recruits ATP-independent mechanism(s) to accelerate endocytosis at the same time as preserving ATP availability for other tasks. To address this issue, we studied ATP requirement in three typical forms of endocytosis at rat calyx of Held terminals by whole-cell membrane capacitance measurements. At room temperature, blocking ATP hydrolysis effectively abolished slow endocytosis and rapid endocytosis but only partially inhibited excess endocytosis following intense stimulation. The ATP-independent endocytosis occurred at calyces from postnatal days 8-15, suggesting its existence before and after hearing onset. This endocytosis was not affected by a reduction of exocytosis using the light chain of botulinum toxin C, nor by block of clathrin-coat maturation. It was abolished by EGTA, which preferentially blocked endocytosis of retrievable membrane pre-existing at the surface, and was impaired by oxidation of cholesterol and inhibition of neutral sphingomyelinase. ATP-independent endocytosis became more significant at 34-35°C, and recovered membrane by an amount that, on average, was close to exocytosis. The results of the present study suggest that activity and temperature recruit ATP-independent endocytosis of pre-existing membrane (in addition to ATP-dependent endocytosis) to efficiently retrieve membrane at nerve terminals. This less understood endocytosis represents a non-canonical mechanism regulated by lipids such as cholesterol and sphingomyelinase.', attributes={'Label': 'ABSTRACT', 'NlmCategory': 'UNASSIGNED'}), ""Comorbidities in Neurology represent a major conceptual and therapeutic challenge. For example, temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a syndrome comprised of epileptic seizures and comorbid symptoms including memory and psychiatric impairment, depression, and sleep dysfunction. Similarly, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are accompanied by various degrees of memory dysfunction. Patients with AD have an increased likelihood for seizures, whereas all four conditions share certain aspects of psychosis, depression, and sleep dysfunction. This remarkable overlap suggests common pathophysiological mechanisms, which include synaptic dysfunction and synaptotoxicity, as well as glial activation and astrogliosis. Astrogliosis is linked to synapse function via the tripartite synapse, but astrocytes also control the availability of gliotransmitters and adenosine. Here we will specifically focus on the 'adenosine hypothesis of comorbidities' implying that astrocyte activation, via overexpression of adenosine kinase (ADK), induces a deficiency in the homeostatic tone of adenosine. We present evidence from patient-derived samples showing astrogliosis and overexpression of ADK as common pathological hallmark of epilepsy, AD, PD, and ALS. We discuss a transgenic 'comorbidity model', in which brain-wide overexpression of ADK and resulting adenosine deficiency produces a comorbid spectrum of seizures, altered dopaminergic function, attentional impairment, and deficits in cognitive domains and sleep regulation. We conclude that dysfunction of adenosine signaling is common in neurological conditions, that adenosine dysfunction can explain co-morbid phenotypes, and that therapeutic adenosine augmentation might be effective for the treatment of comorbid symptoms in multiple neurological conditions. "", 'Endocytosis in synapses sustains neurotransmission by recycling vesicle membrane and maintaining the homeostasis of synaptic membrane. A role of membrane cholesterol in synaptic endocytosis remains controversial because of conflicting observations, technical limitations in previous studies, and potential interference from non-specific effects after cholesterol manipulation. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether cholesterol participates in distinct forms of endocytosis that function under different activity levels. In this study, applying the whole-cell membrane capacitance measurement to monitor endocytosis in real time at the rat calyx of Held terminals, we found that disrupting cholesterol with dialysis of cholesterol oxidase or methyl-β-cyclodextrin impaired three different forms of endocytosis, including slow endocytosis, rapid endocytosis, and endocytosis of the retrievable membrane that exists at the surface before stimulation. The effects were observed when disruption of cholesterol was mild enough not to change Ca(2+) channel current or vesicle exocytosis, indicative of stringent cholesterol requirement in synaptic endocytosis. Extracting cholesterol with high concentrations of methyl-β-cyclodextrin reduced exocytosis, mainly by decreasing the readily releasable pool and the vesicle replenishment after readily releasable pool depletion. Our study suggests that cholesterol is an important, universal regulator in multiple forms of vesicle endocytosis at mammalian central synapses.']"

However, the concept that the beneficial effects are attributable to direct antioxidant activity in vivo does not pay sufficient heed to the fact that polyphenols degrade rapidly, are poorly absorbed and rapidly metabolized, resulting in very low bioavailability. This review explores alternative mechanisms by which polyphenols, or their metabolites, exert biological activity via mechanisms that can be activated by physiologically relevant concentrations. Evidence is presented to support the action of phenolic derivatives on receptors and signalling pathways to induce adaptive responses that drive changes in endogenous antioxidant, antiplatelet, vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The implications are that in vitro antioxidant measures as predictors of polyphenol protective activity in vivo hold little relevance and that closer attention needs to be paid to bioavailable metabolites to understand the mode of action of these diet-derived components.', StringElement('This article is part of a themed section on Principles of Pharmacological Research of Nutraceuticals.

"['Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of the sexually transmitted infection (STI) gonorrhea, is a growing public health threat for which a vaccine is urgently needed.

MetQ has been found to be highly conserved in all strains investigated to date, it is localized on the bacterial surface, and it binds l-methionine with a high affinity. MetQ is also involved in gonococcal adherence to cervical epithelial cells. Mutants lacking MetQ have impaired survival in human monocytes, macrophages, and serum.

Here, we probe the origin of this metal specificity using a phenotypic growth analysis of pneumococcal variants. Structural homology to Escherichia coli YiiP predicts that both MntE and CzcD are dimeric and each protomer harbors four pairs of conserved metal-binding sites, termed the A site, the B site, and the C1/C2 binuclear site. We find that single amino acid mutations within both the transmembrane domain A site and the B site in both CDFs result in a cellular metal sensitivity similar to that of the corresponding null mutants.

Deletion of the MntE-specific C-terminal tail, present only in Mn-specific bacterial CDFs, resulted in only a modest growth phenotype.

"['A characteristic feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is accumulation of apoptotic resistant fibroblasts/myofibroblasts in the fibroblastic foci. As caveolin (Cav)-null mice develop pulmonary fibrosis (PF), we hypothesized that the participating fibroblasts display an apoptosis-resistant phenotype. To test this hypothesis and identify the molecular mechanisms involved we isolated lung fibroblasts from Cav-null mice and examined the expression of several inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), of c-FLIP, of Bcl-2 proteins and of the death receptor CD95/Fas. We found significant increase in XIAP and c-FLIP constitutive protein expression with no alteration of Bcl-2 and lower levels of CD95/Fas. The isolated fibroblasts were then treated with the CD95/Fas ligand (FasL) to induce apoptosis. While the morphological and biochemical alterations induced by FasL were similar in wild-type (wt) and Cav-null mouse lung fibroblasts, the time course and the extent of the alterations were greater in the Cav-null fibroblasts. Several salient features of Cav-null fibroblasts response such as loss of membrane potential, fragmentation of the mitochondrial continuum concurrent with caspase-8 activation, and subsequent Bid cleavage, prior to caspase-3 activation were detected. Furthermore, M30 antigen formation, phosphatidylserine expression and DNA fragmentation were caspase-3 dependent. SiRNA-mediated silencing of XIAP and c-FLIP, individually or combined, enhanced the sensitivity of lung fibroblasts to FasL-induced apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of Bcl-2 had no effect. Together our findings support a mechanism in which CD95/Fas engagement activates caspase-8, inducing mitochondrial apoptosis through Bid cleavage. XIAP and c-FLIP fine tune this process in a cell-type specific manner.', StringElement('Cell-associated HIV-1 infection has been proposed to play a pivotal role in the spread of HIV-1 infection. Granulocytes are a category of white blood cells, comprising mainly basophils, neutrophils, and eosinophils, and participate in various inflammatory reactions and defense against pathogens. Here, we investigated the role of human blood granulocytes in the dissemination of HIV-1. These cells were found to express a variety of HIV-1 attachment factors (HAFs). Basophils expressed HAFs dendritic cell (DC)-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM3)-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), DC immunoreceptor (DCIR), heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), and α4β7 integrin and mediated the most efficient capture of HIV-1 on the cell surface. Neutrophils were found to express DCIR and demonstrated limited efficiency of viral capture. Eosinophils expressed α4β7 integrin but exhibited little or no virus-binding capacity. Intriguingly, following direct contact with CD4+ T cells, viruses harbored on the surface of basophils were transferred to T cells. The contact between basophils and CD4+ T cells and formation of infectious synapses appeared necessary for efficient HIV-1 spread. In HIV-1-infected individuals, the frequency of basophils remained fairly stable over the course of disease, regardless of CD4+ T depletion or the emergence of AIDS-associated opportunistic infections.

Evidence derived from both in vitro studies and recent animal models points to a pathogenic role of ANCAs in AAV. In 2002, the first in vivo breakthrough in the pathogenesis of ANCAs showed that mouse ANCAs against myeloperoxidase (MPO) led to intrinsic pauci-immune renal vasculitis in mice. In 2004, a report using both in vitro and in vivo studies proposed that proteinase 3 (PR3)-directed autoimmunity involved the complementary peptide of PR3 (cPR3), which is encoded by the antisense strand of the PR3 gene. The last breakthrough came in October 2008 with a previously undescribed molecular explanation for the origin and development of injury in pauci-immune renal vasculitis, with potential clinical implications. This report showed that infection by fimbriated bacteria may trigger cross-reactive autoimmunity to a previously characterized ANCA antigen, lysosomal membrane protein-2, which is contained in the same vesicles that harbor MPO and PR3. Infection by fimbriated bacteria resulted in the production of autoantibodies, which activated neutrophils and killed human microvascular endothelium in vitro and caused renal vasculitis in rats. Although the evidence for a pathogenic role of ANCAs, mainly MPO-ANCAs, is striking, various questions remain unanswered.

The in vivo effect of ART on the growth of human CML xenograft tumors in athymic nu/nu mice was also examined. In our preliminary experiments, we first observed that phosphorylation of p38, ERK, CREB, Chk-2, STAT5, and RSK proteins were suppressed upon ART exposure. Interestingly, ART induced the expression of SOCS-1 protein and depletion of SOCS-1 using siRNA abrogated the STAT5 inhibitory effect of the drug. Also various dephosphorylations caused by ART led to the suppression of various survival gene products and induced apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. Moreover, ART also substantially potentiated the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Finally, when administered intraperitoneally, ART inhibited p38, ERK, STAT5, and CREB activation in tumor tissues and the growth of human CML xenograft tumors in mice without exhibiting any significant adverse effects. Overall, our results suggest that ART exerts its anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects through suppression of multiple signaling cascades in CML both in vitro and in vivo.

Although several anti-HIV cellular microRNAs have been described, such a regulation for HTLV-1 has not been reported. In this study, we found that miR-28-3p inhibits HTLV-1 virus expression and its replication by targeting a specific site within the genomic gag/pol viral mRNA. Because miR-28-3p is highly expressed in resting T cells, which are resistant to HTLV-1 infection, we investigated a potential protective role of miR-28-3p against de novo HTLV-1 infection. To this end, we developed a new sensitive and quantitative assay on the basis of the detection of products of reverse transcription. We demonstrate that miR-28-3p does not prevent virus receptor interaction or virus entry but, instead, induces a post-entry block at the reverse transcription level. In addition, we found that HTLV-1, subtype 1A isolates corresponding to the Japanese strain ATK-1 present a natural, single-nucleotide polymorphism within the miR-28-3p target site. As a result of this polymorphism, the ATK-1 virus sequence was not inhibited by miR-28. Interestingly, genetic studies on the transmission of the virus has shown that the ATK-1 strain, which carries a Thr-to-Cys transition mutation, is transmitted efficiently between spouses, suggesting that miR-28 may play an important role in HTLV-1 transmission.

Two weeks of muscle ablation resulted in a 40% increase in muscle mass, which was associated with a significant increase in silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) content and activity (P\xa0<\xa00.001). SIRT1-regulated Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and GLUT4 levels were also induced in hypertrophied muscles, and SIRT1 levels correlated with muscle mass, paired box protein 7 (Pax7), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) levels.

To close this gap, we used a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach applied to in vitro myogenesis. Furthermore, to minimize sample genetic heterogeneity and muscle-type specific patterns of gene expression, miRNA profiling from NGS data was filtered with FC ≥ 4 (log(2)FC ≥ 2) and p-value<0.05, and its validation was derived by qRT-PCR on myoblasts from seven muscle districts. In particular, control myogenesis showed the modulation of 38 miRNAs, the majority of which (34 out 38) were up-regulated, including myomiRs (miR-1, -133a, -133b and -206). Approximately one third of the modulated miRNAs were not previously reported to be involved in muscle differentiation, and interestingly some of these (i.e. miR-874, -1290, -95 and -146a) were previously shown to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. FSHD myogenesis evidenced a reduced number of modulated miRNAs than healthy muscle cells. The two processes shared nine miRNAs, including myomiRs, although with FC values lower in FSHD than in control cells. In addition, FSHD cells showed the modulation of six miRNAs (miR-1268, -1268b, -1908, 4258, -4508- and -4516) not evidenced in control cells and that therefore could be considered FSHD-specific, likewise three novel miRNAs that seem to be specifically expressed in FSHD myotubes. These data further clarify the impact of miRNA regulation during control myogenesis and strongly suggest that a complex dysregulation of miRNA expression characterizes FSHD, impairing two important features of myogenesis: cell cycle and muscle development.

"['Despite advances in the surgical and medical treatment of bladder cancer, there have only been minor improvements in mortality and morbidity rates over the past decades. Urine-based markers help to improve diagnosing bladder cancer with the aim of complementing or probably in future replacing cystoscopy. Biomarkers may allow individualized risk stratification and support decision-making regarding therapy and follow-up. This review summarizes the existing urine-based biomarkers in bladder cancer. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature. We conducted a PubMed/Medline based research on English language articles and selected original articles and review articles that provided both description and assessment of urinary markers at time of screening, initial diagnosis, monitoring and prognostic evaluation of urothelial bladder cancer. Our research covered studies published between 2000 and 2017. The aim of this study was to give clinicians keys to understand the existing or promising urinary markers that may become alternatives to cytology/cystoscopy pair in the near future. Many urinary markers are now available, often with superior sensitivity to cytology. Their uses have been evaluated in numerous clinical situations in addition to the time of initial diagnosis and surveillance such as cases of isolated macroscopic hematuria or atypical cytology discordant with the rest of the explorations. However, their superiority over the cytology/cystoscopy association is not demonstrated. These new markers are lacking for the most part of standardization and simplicity making their use in common practice difficult. the types and forms of these new markers are very heterogeneous among themselves and between the studies that evaluate them.

Chemical oxidation and enzymatic deglycosylation in situ were performed to investigate the immunoreactivity of the carbohydrate moieties. Linearizing or removing the carbohydrate moieties from the protein backbones did not diminish the immunoreactivity of these antigens, suggesting that a substantial part of the host immune response against T. solium oncosphere is directed against the peptide epitopes on the parasite antigens.

"['Ligand-bound nuclear receptors (NR) activate transcription of the target genes. This activation is coupled with histone modifications and chromatin remodeling through the function of various coregulators. However, the nature of the dependence of a NR coregulator action on the presence of the chromatin environment at the target genes is unclear. To address this issue, we have developed a modified position effect variegation experimental model system that includes an androgen-dependent reporter transgene inserted into either a pericentric heterochromatin region or a euchromatic region of Drosophila chromosome. Human androgen receptor (AR) and its constitutively active truncation mutant (AR AF-1) were transcriptionally functional in both chromosomal regions. Predictably, the level of AR-induced transactivation was lower in the pericentric heterochromatin. In genetic screening for AR AF-1 coregulators, Drosophila CREB binding protein (dCBP) was found to corepress AR transactivation at the pericentric region whereas it led to coactivation in the euchromatic area. Mutations of Sir2 acetylation sites or deletion of the CBP acetyltransferase domain abrogated dCBP corepressive action for AR at heterochromatic areas in vivo. Such a CBP corepressor function for AR was observed in the transcriptionally silent promoter of an AR target gene in cultured mammalian cells.

"['Discussion. Autoimmune leukopenia is a common presentation in SLE, occurring in 50-60% of patients.

As neutropenia is usually mild, there are currently no guidelines for therapy. For our patient, we started him on low dose IV solumedrol and found that he responded drastically to treatment. Given strongly positive nonspecific anti-neutrophil antibodies in the setting of a negative ANA noted in our patient, it is likely that there are other currently unknown antibodies associated with SLE which may correlate strongly with autoimmune neutropenia.', 'Our purpose was to compile information on the haematological manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), namely leucopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and myelofibrosis. During our search of the English-language MEDLINE sources, we did not place a date-of-publication constraint. Hence, we have reviewed previous as well as most recent studies with the subject heading SLE in combination with each manifestation. Neutropenia can lead to morbidity and mortality from increased susceptibility to infection. Severe neutropenia can be successfully treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. While related to disease activity, there is no specific therapy for lymphopenia. Severe lymphopenia may require the use of prophylactic therapy to prevent select opportunistic infections. Isolated idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura maybe the first manifestation of SLE by months or even years. Some manifestations of lupus occur more frequently in association with low platelet count in these patients, for example, neuropsychiatric manifestation, haemolytic anaemia, the antiphospholipid syndrome and renal disease. Thrombocytopenia can be regarded as an important prognostic indicator of survival in patients with SLE. Medical, surgical and biological treatment modalities are reviewed for this manifestation. First-line therapy remains glucocorticoids. Through our review, we conclude glucocorticoids do produce a response in majority of patients initially, but sustained response to therapy is unlikely. Glucocorticoids are used as first-line therapy in patients with SLE with AIHA, but there is no conclusive evidence to guide second-line therapy. Rituximab is promising in refractory and non-responding AIHA.

"['Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., has recently been recognized as an emerging infectious disease worldwide. Despite its severity and global importance, knowledge about the molecular pathogenesis and virulence evolution of Leptospira spp. remains limited. Here we sequenced and analyzed 102 isolates representing global sources. A high genomic variability were observed among different Leptospira species, which was attributed to massive gene gain and loss events allowing for adaptation to specific niche conditions and changing host environments. Horizontal gene transfer and gene duplication allowed the stepwise acquisition of virulence factors in pathogenic Leptospira evolved from a recent common ancestor. More importantly, the abundant expansion of specific virulence-related protein families, such as metalloproteases-associated paralogs, were exclusively identified in pathogenic species, reflecting the importance of these protein families in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis. Our observations also indicated that positive selection played a crucial role on this bacteria adaptation to hosts. These novel findings may lead to greater understanding of the global diversity and virulence evolution of Leptospira spp. ', ""The translational GTPase BipA regulates the expression of virulence and pathogenicity factors in several eubacteria. BipA-dependent expression of virulence factors occurs under starvation conditions, such as encountered during infection of a host. Under these conditions, BipA associates with the small ribosomal subunit. BipA also has a second function to promote the efficiency of late steps in biogenesis of large ribosomal subunits at low temperatures, presumably while bound to the ribosome. During starvation, the cellular concentration of stress alarmone guanosine-3', 5'-bis pyrophosphate (ppGpp) is increased. This increase allows ppGpp to bind to BipA and switch its binding specificity from ribosomes to small ribosomal subunits. A conformational change of BipA upon ppGpp binding could explain the ppGpp regulation of the binding specificity of BipA. Here, we present the structures of the full-length BipA from Escherichia coli in apo, GDP-, and ppGpp-bound forms. The crystal structure and small-angle x-ray scattering data of the protein with bound nucleotides, together with a thermodynamic analysis of the binding of GDP and of ppGpp to BipA, indicate that the ppGpp-bound form of BipA adopts the structure of the GDP form. This suggests furthermore, that the switch in binding preference only occurs when both ppGpp and the small ribosomal subunit are present. This molecular mechanism would allow BipA to interact with both the ribosome and the small ribosomal subunit during stress response. "", StringElement('The bacterial BipA protein belongs to the EF-G family of translational GTPases and has been postulated to be either a regulatory translation factor or a ribosome assembly factor. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we analyzed the effect of bipA deletion on three phenotypes associated with ribosome assembly factors: cold sensitivity, ribosome subunit distribution, and rRNA processing. We demonstrated that a ΔbipA strain exhibits a cold-sensitive phenotype that is similar to, and synergistic with, that of a strain with a known ribosome assembly factor, deaD. Additionally, the bipA deletion strain displayed a perturbed ribosome subunit distribution when grown at low temperature, similar to that of a deaD mutant, and again, the double mutant showed additive effects. The primary ribosomal deficiency noted was a decreased level of the 50S subunit and the appearance of a presumed pre-50S particle. Finally, deletion of bipA resulted in accumulation of pre23S rRNA, as did deletion of deaD. We further found that deletion of rluC, which encodes a pseudouridine synthase that modifies the 23S rRNA at three sites, suppressed all three phenotypes of the bipA mutant, supporting and extending previous findings.

"['Despite advances in the surgical and medical treatment of bladder cancer, there have only been minor improvements in mortality and morbidity rates over the past decades. Urine-based markers help to improve diagnosing bladder cancer with the aim of complementing or probably in future replacing cystoscopy. Biomarkers may allow individualized risk stratification and support decision-making regarding therapy and follow-up. This review summarizes the existing urine-based biomarkers in bladder cancer. We conducted a comprehensive review of the literature. We conducted a PubMed/Medline based research on English language articles and selected original articles and review articles that provided both description and assessment of urinary markers at time of screening, initial diagnosis, monitoring and prognostic evaluation of urothelial bladder cancer. Our research covered studies published between 2000 and 2017. The aim of this study was to give clinicians keys to understand the existing or promising urinary markers that may become alternatives to cytology/cystoscopy pair in the near future. Many urinary markers are now available, often with superior sensitivity to cytology. Their uses have been evaluated in numerous clinical situations in addition to the time of initial diagnosis and surveillance such as cases of isolated macroscopic hematuria or atypical cytology discordant with the rest of the explorations. However, their superiority over the cytology/cystoscopy association is not demonstrated. These new markers are lacking for the most part of standardization and simplicity making their use in common practice difficult. the types and forms of these new markers are very heterogeneous among themselves and between the studies that evaluate them. Well-designed protocols and prospective, controlled trials are needed to provide the basis to determine whether integration of urine- and blood-based biomarkers into clinical decision-making will be of value for bladder cancer detection and screening in the future.', StringElement('This review aims to evaluate research surrounding the utility of urinary biomarkers to detect bladder cancer and predict recurrence.', attributes={'Label': 'PURPOSE OF REVIEW', 'NlmCategory': 'OBJECTIVE'}), StringElement('Recent research has focussed on the evaluation of genetic markers found in urine to provide diagnostic and prognostic information.

The identification and validation of bladder tumour specific molecular markers in urine could enable tumour detection and reduce reliance on cystoscopy, and numerous classes of biomarkers have been studied. Proteins represent the most intensively studied class of biomolecule in this setting. As an aid to researchers searching for better urinary biomarkers, we report a comprehensive systematic review of the literature and a searchable database of proteins that have been investigated to date. Our objective was to classify these proteins as: 1) those with robustly characterised sensitivity and specificity for bladder cancer detection; 2) those that show potential but further investigation is required; 3) those unlikely to warrant further investigation; and 4) those investigated as prognostic markers.

In the inside-out mode, α1C and α1C∆ showed minimal open-probabilities in a basic internal solution (run-down), whereas α1C∆ with CaM and α1C∆CaM maintained detectable channel activity, confirming that CaM was necessary, but not sufficient, for channel activity.

However, α1C∆ with CaM\xa0+\xa0ATP and α1C∆CaM with ATP maintained activity, even in the late phase (after 7-9\xa0min).

This study tests the hypothesis that DCT attenuates cardiomyocyte I(Ca,L). We measured LTCC current and Ca(2+) transients with DCT coexpressed in murine cardiomyocytes. We also heterologously coexpressed DCT and Ca(V)1.2 constructs with truncations corresponding to the predicted proteolytic cleavage site, Ca(V)1.2Δ1801, and a shorter deletion corresponding to well-studied construct, Ca(V)1.2Δ1733. DCT inhibited I(Ba,L) in cardiomyocytes, and in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing Ca(V)1.2Δ1801 and Ca(V)1.2Δ1733. Ca(2+)-CaM relieved DCT block in cardiomyocytes and HEK cells. The selective block of I(Ba,L) combined with Ca(2+)-CaM effects suggested that DCT-mediated blockade may be relieved under conditions of elevated Ca(2+). We therefore tested the hypothesis that DCT block is dynamic, increasing under relatively low Ca(2+), and show that DCT reduced diastolic Ca(2+) at low stimulation frequencies but spared high frequency Ca(2+) entry. DCT reduction of diastolic Ca(2+) and relief of block at high pacing frequencies and under conditions of supraphysiological bath Ca(2+) suggests that a physiological function of DCT is to increase the dynamic range of Ca(2+) transients in response to elevated pacing frequencies.

The ethylene dependence of CaTin1 induction upon TMV inoculation was demonstrated by the decrease of CaTin1 expression in response to several inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis or its action. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants expressing CaTin1 gene in sense- or antisense-orientation showed interesting characteristics such as the accelerated growth and the enhanced resistance to biotic as well as abiotic stresses. Such characteristics appear to be caused by the elevated level of ethylene and H2O2. Moreover, in transgenic plants expressing antisense CaTin1 gene, the expression of some pathogenesis-related genes was enhanced constitutively, which may be mainly due to the increased ethylene level. The promoter of CaTin1 has four GCC-boxes, two AT-rich regions, and an elicitor-inducible W-box. The induction of the promoter activity by ethylene depends on GCC-boxes and by TMV on W-box.

"['Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a common risk factor for the development of liver cancer. The molecular mechanisms underlying this effect are only partially understood.

In addition, we show that NORE1A colocalizes to sites of HCV viral replication and suppresses the replication process. Thus, NORE1A has antiviral activity, which is specifically antagonized by NS5B. Moreover, the suppression of NORE1A protein levels correlated almost perfectly with elevation of Ras activity in primary human samples. Therefore, NORE1A inactivation by NS5B may be essential for maximal HCV replication and may make a major contribution to HCV-induced liver cancer by shifting Ras signaling away from prosenescent/proapoptotic signaling pathways.', StringElement('HCV uses NS5B to specifically suppress NORE1A, facilitating viral replication and elevated Ras signaling.

Such viruses are often highly pathogenic (e.g., influenza virus, HIV, Ebola virus) and routinely circumvent therapeutic intervention through mutational escape. Error-prone genome replication generates heterogeneous viral populations that rapidly adapt to new selection pressures, leading to resistance that emerges with treatment. However, population heterogeneity bears a cost: when multiple viral variants replicate within a cell, they can potentially interfere with each other, lowering viral fitness. This genetic interference can be exploited for antiviral strategies, either by taking advantage of a virus's inherent genetic diversity or through generating de novo interference by engineering a competing genome. Here, we discuss two such antiviral strategies, dominant drug targeting and therapeutic interfering particles. Both strategies harness the power of genetic interference to surmount two particularly vexing obstacles-the evolution of drug resistance and targeting therapy to high-risk populations-both of which impede treatment in resource-poor settings.

"[StringElement('Remodeling of the host cytoskeleton is a common strategy employed by bacterial pathogens. Although there is vigorous investigation of the cell biology underlying these bacterially mediated cytoskeleton modifications, knowledge of the plasticity and dynamics of the bacterial signaling networks that regulate the expression of genes necessary for these phenotypes is lacking. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli attaches to enterocytes, forming pedestal-like structures. Pedestal formation requires the expression of the locus-of-enterocyte-effacement (LEE) and espFu genes. The LEE encodes a molecular syringe, a type III secretion system (T3SS) used by pathogens to translocate effectors such as EspFu into the host cell. By using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and cell biology approaches, we show that pedestal formation relies on posttranscriptional regulation by two small RNAs (sRNAs), GlmY and GlmZ. The GlmY and GlmZ sRNAs are unique; they have extensive secondary structures and work in concert. Although these sRNAs may offer unique insights into RNA and posttranscriptional biology, thus far, only one target and one mechanism of action (exposure of the ribosome binding site from the glmS gene to promote its translation) has been described. Here we uncovered new targets and two different molecular mechanisms of action of these sRNAs. In the case of EspFu expression, they promote translation by cleavage of the transcript, while in regard to the LEE, they promote destabilization of the mRNA.

These sRNAs quickly allow for plasticity in gene expression in order for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli to fine-tune the expression of its complex type III secretion machinery and its effectors to promote bacterial attachment and subsequent actin rearrangement on host cells. Pedestal formation is a very dynamic process. Many of the genes necessary for pedestal formation are located within the same operon to evolutionarily guarantee that they are inherited together.
